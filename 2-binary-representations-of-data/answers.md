- The answer is -1 which is correct. This does match my expectations.
- We can negate a number in two's complement by flipping all the bits and adding one. We can compute subtraction by adding the negation of the number to subtract.
- Most significant bit is -128 in 8-bit two's complement. Most significant bit is -2^31 in 32-bit two's complement.


## 2.5

Can detect overflow by checking that only either carry out or carry in occurs, but not simultaneously

This is big-endian

Was getting so confused with this one. First: emoji on apple keyboard is not the same as the emoji on the site. Second, forgot to do echo -n, so was getting extra bytes. Finally did it right: 
```
$ echo -n â˜ƒ > snowman.txt
$ xxd snowman.txt
```
Got 3 bytes.

Expect to see `11100010 10011000 10000011`. Verified! Nice!!

`01101000 01100101 01101101 01101101 01101111` -> "hello" in ASCII.

Looks like we're dealing with UTF-8.

Leading 0 tripped me up here:
```
11110000 10011111 10011000 10000000 ->
0 0001 1111 0110 0000 0000 ->
0x1F600 ->
